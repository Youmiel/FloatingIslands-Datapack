# FloatingIslands1.16.x-Datapack
- A minecraft datapack that creates floating islands in overworld and the nether.
- Terrain noise in `overworld` and `the nether` is similar to `the end`, but sightly changed
  - Overworld sea level has changed to 0 for better vegetation on overworld islands, also avoiding sea ravine from generating in the void
- End gateways are distributed randomly in overworld and the nether, targeting (0,0)
  - Below are the biomes that end gateways may generate:
    - deep_ocean
    - desert
    - forest
    - mountains
    - ocean
    - plains
    - savanna
    - swamp
    - taiga
    - nether_wastes
    - soul_sand_valley
